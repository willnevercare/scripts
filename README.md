# Cloud Network
This is a collection of Linux Scripts and Ansible Scripts from my Cyber class.

Most of these scripts are used to configure cloud servers with different dock containers.

The final setup was 2 servers running vurnable DVWA containers along with a jumpserver/elk stack container in one.
